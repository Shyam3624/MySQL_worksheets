**🛒 Ecommerce SQL Analytics Project**

**🚀 Overview**

This project showcases advanced SQL skills using an Ecommerce Database. It includes optimized queries for sales analysis, customer behavior insights, and performance tuning using indexes — perfect for BI, dashboards, and backend reporting.

**🧩 Dataset**
A custom Ecommerce SQL Database with the following tables:

1.Customers

2.Orders

3.OrderDetails

4.Products

**Schema includes:**

Primary & foreign keys

Realistic data types (names, dates, categories, prices)

You can find the SQL schema & insert scripts in the /database folder.
**
****🎯 Key Concepts Covered**

**🔍 SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY**
Total sales per product

Orders by customer with filters and sorting

Category-wise performance

🔗 JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
Customer and order relationships

Products linked with order details

Handling missing product sales (LEFT JOIN)

**🧠 Subqueries**
Top customers based on average order value

Products that sold above the average category price

📊 Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG)
Monthly revenue

Customer lifetime value

Inventory totals per category

**👁️‍🗨️ Views for Analysis**
view_total_sales_per_product

view_customer_spending

view_unsold_products

view_monthly_revenue

**⚡ Query Optimization with Indexes**
Indexed foreign keys for faster JOINs

Indexed filters on order_date, category, and customer_id

Composite indexes for covering queries
